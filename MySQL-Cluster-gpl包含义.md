MySQL-server-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm 

The MySQL server. You need this unless you only want to connect to a MySQL server running on another machine. 

MySQL-client-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm 

The standard MySQL client programs. You probably always want to install this package. 

MySQL-devel-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm 

The libraries and include files that are needed if you want to compile other MySQL clients, such as the Perl modules. 

MySQL-debuginfo-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm 

This package contains debugging information. debuginfo RPMs are never needed to use MySQL software; this is true both for the server and for client programs. However, they contain additional information that might be needed by a debugger to analyze a crash. 

MySQL-shared-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm 

This package contains the shared libraries (libmysqlclient.so*) that certain languages and applications need to dynamically load and use MySQL. It contains single-threaded and thread-safe libraries. If you install this package, do not install the MySQL-shared-compat package. 

MySQL-shared-compat-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm 

This package includes the shared libraries for MySQL 3.23, 4.0, and so on, up to the current release. It contains single-threaded and thread-safe libraries. Install this package instead of MySQL-shared if you have applications installed that are dynamically linked against older versions of MySQL but you want to upgrade to the current version without breaking the library dependencies. 

MySQL-shared-compat-advanced-gpl-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm, MySQL-shared-compat-advanced-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm 

These are like the MySQL-shared-compat package, but are for the “MySQL Enterprise Server – Advanced Edition” products. Install these packages rather than the normal MySQL-shared-compat package if you want to included shared client libraries for older MySQL versions. 

MySQL-embedded-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm 

The embedded MySQL server library. 

MySQL-ndb-management-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm, MySQL-ndb-storage-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm, MySQL-ndb-tools-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm, MySQL-ndb-extra-VERSION.glibc23.i386.rpm
